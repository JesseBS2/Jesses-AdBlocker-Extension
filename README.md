# Description

Did you know you can code your extensions for web browsers? And using provided libraries you can remove content and block websites. 
Websites typically display Ads by using an ad service. These services get paid by other companies to display their banners/videos/segments on websites. This comes with the added benefit to the consumer that the content of these ads is stored neatly on a website, and by blocking those websites. Those ads can be removed.

Sometimes ads are built in to/sourced from the website you're trying to visit. So blocking it wouldn't make since, this Ad Blocker also has a built in element searcher that loops throught the website and looks for sections labeled "ad" or "promoted" and the like and hides those as well. 

I've bundled all versions of this Ad-blocker under one repository because I intend to make a version of this for all major browsers and I didn't want 5 repositories that are essentially the same thing on my page.



# Download and Setup

To use these ad blockers, just download the repository as a `.zip` file to your computer.
Unzip the document, keep the folder for your browser, discard the rest. Each folder has an included `.txt` file that explains how to set up the extension for that browser.
